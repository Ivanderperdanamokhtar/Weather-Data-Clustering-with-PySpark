# Weather Data Analysis

This project utilizes the [Weather Data Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/weather-data) from Kaggle, which provides hourly meteorological observations. The dataset can be used for exploratory analysis, forecasting, and machine learning tasks.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Kaggle ([Weather Data by Prasad Ostwal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/weather-data))
- **Format:** CSV
- **Attributes:**
  - `Formatted Date`: Timestamp of the record
  - `Summary`: General weather summary
  - `Precip Type`: Type of precipitation (rain/snow)
  - `Temperature (C)`: Temperature in Celsius
  - `Apparent Temperature (C)`: Feels-like temperature
  - `Humidity`: Humidity level
  - `Wind Speed (km/h)`: Wind speed
  - `Wind Bearing (degrees)`: Wind direction
  - `Visibility (km)`: Visibility
  - `Pressure (millibars)`: Atmospheric pressure
  - `Daily Summary`: Summary of the day

## 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the weather data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends such as:
  - Temperature over time
  - Relationship between humidity and temperature
  - Wind speed and pressure patterns
- (Optional) Build predictive models to forecast temperature or other metrics

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
